# Eat-Da-Burger--Node-Express-Handlebars-MVC
We will create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The application will follow the Move-View-Controller design pattern. This app will use Node and MySQL to query and route data and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

* [Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works](https://youtu.be/msvdn95x9OM).
