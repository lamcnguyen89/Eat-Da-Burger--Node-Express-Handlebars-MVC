# Eat-Da-Burger--Node-Express-Handlebars-MVC

[![License: Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)](http://unlicense.org/)

We will create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The application will follow the Move-View-Controller design pattern. This app will use Node and MySQL to query and route data and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
